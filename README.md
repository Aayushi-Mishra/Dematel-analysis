# Dematel-analysis

## Abstract 
This project addresses the prevalent issue of heightened stress levels among students, particularly those pursuing professional degrees such as engineering. The resulting psychological challenges, including major depression and mental issues, underscore the urgency of addressing mental health concerns. With a focus on college campuses as hubs of intellectual activity, this study explores the opportunity and responsibility these institutions have in creating, assessing, and sharing best practices for mitigating student stress. The project emphasizes the impact of hectic schedules, late meals, and inadequate sleep on the physical and mental well-being of students. 

Utilizing a quantitative approach through a sample survey and employing the DEMATEL approach, the study analyzes stressors among engineering students, unveiling factors such as social media influence, academic expectations, relationship complexities, and the unique challenges posed by events like the COVID-19 pandemic. The findings contribute valuable insights for developing targeted interventions and support systems, emphasizing the pivotal role that colleges play in addressing a critical public health issue affecting late adolescents and young adults.

## Dematel Approach:
"Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL)" method is helpful for examining the relationships between the causes and effects of a system's constituent parts. Because it reveals the interfaces between the criteria, this approach is better than traditional ones. The criteria indicate the degree to which they influence each other and are rated based on the kind of relationship. To ascertain impact and causation, apply the DEMATEL approach. Linguistic variables as well as triangular fuzzy numbers, and improve the model's flexibility to both types of criteria. By proposing an alternative method for providing an evaluation that permits the modelling of the cause and effect of risk factors and the analytical disclosure of the degree or strength of influence, DEMATEL makes a contribution to the literature on risk assessment.

## Steps in DEMATEL

•	To gather experts’ opinion and calculate the average matrix Z.

•	To calculate the normalized initial direct relation matrix D.

•	To derive the total relation matrix T.

•	To calculate the sums of rows and columns of matrix T.

•	To set the threshold value α.

•	To build a cause-and-effect relationship diagram.

•	To evaluate the acceptability of the cause-and-effect diagram

•	The final cause-and effect relations.
